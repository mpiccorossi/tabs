 A   F#m   D   E   A

  When the night has come
F#m
  And the land is dark
              D         E                 A
  And the moon is the only light we'll see

  No, I won't be afraid,
        Fm
  No, I won't be afraid
              D            E             A
  Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

Chorus:

So, darling, darling, stand by me,
    Fm
Oh, stand by me.
    D     E           A
Oh, stand, stand by me,
Stand by me.

  If the sea that we look upon
  Should tumble and fall
  Or the mountain should crumble in the sea,
  I won't cry, I won't cry,
  No, I won't shed a tear
  Just as long as you stand, stand by me.

Chorus
