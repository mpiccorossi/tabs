Capo 3nd fret

G D/F# Em7 D C

G                  Em7
There's a blood red circle
       C               G
On the cold dark ground
       G    D/F# Em7   D    C
And the rain is falling down
    G                   Em7
The church doors thrown open
               C           G
I can hear the organ's song
       G     D/F# Em7 D    C
But the congregation's gone
                G Em7 C G
My city of ruins
                G Em7 C G
My city of ruins


        G                Em7
Now the sweet bells of mercy
                  C            G
Drift through the evening trees
                 G      D/F# Em7     D       C
Young men on the corner like scattered leaves
    G                 Em7
The boarded up windows
    C            G
The empty streets
       G       D/F# Em7     D     C
And my brother's down on his knees
                G Em7 C G
My city of ruins
                G Em7 C G
My city of ruins


C
Come on rise up
        D    G
Come on rise up
C
Come on rise up
        D    G
Come on rise up

        D    G

        G D/F# Em7  D  C
Come on riiiiiiiiise up

            G            Em7
Now there's tears on the pillow
        C        G
Darling where we slept
        G       D/F#  Em7     D    C
And you took my heart when you left
             G              Em7
Without your sweet kiss my soul
   C         G
Is lost, my friend
        G D/F# Em7  D     C
Tell me how do I begin again

                  G Em7 C G
My city's in ruins
                  G Em7 C G
My city's in ruins


    G          Em7     C               G
