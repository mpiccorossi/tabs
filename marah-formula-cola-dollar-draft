Formula, Cola, Dollar Draft

E                        B 
There was a time when I didn't talk
C#m                     A 
I'd look away, or I'd shrug it off
G#m              A 
Turn it out or turn it off
                   B
Or say something short and soft

E                      B
Out of school I took a J-O-B
C#m                  A
Makin' buttons in a factory
G#m                          A
Thinking what does life got in for me?
               B
And I didn't wanna know

E                   B
In a city full of double deals
C#m                               A
My boss would yawn and roll back on his heels
G#m                A              B
Like anyone could cop a feel of lady luck

E                    B
I was made with my brother Bill
C#m                               A
Drinking Muskie Moons on top of Laurel Hill
G#m                           A             B
It's funny now I'd cheek a poison pill to sober up

E                      B
And no two-bit claim of I'm all right
C#m              A
Is gonna turn around and make it right
G#m                          A
So I'm fishing in my pocket for a light
B
And I'm standin' on the corner on a Saturday night

(Harmonica solo, same chords)

E
I seen pigeons flap their filthy wings
B
To a freezing sunset in the west
C#m
Rain shit down from their haunted perch
A
In the bells above St. Someone's church
G#m
The Sexton drinks and dreams in bed
A
One eye in a line of light
B
Startled by a ghost he screams his dead wife's name into the night

E
Which echoes down a cobbled hall
B
Bounces off a gray stone floor
C#m
Fired down a line of stairs
A
Where it's silenced by a door
G#m
Beyond which I am leaning, leaning
A
Watching cars and dreaming
B
As steam rose 'round my body like my soul up to the stars

E
I guess the devil's had his way with town
B
Now that Willie is in the ground
C#m
And I guess the devil made me this
A
When he gave me no one I can't resist
G#m
I got the bill today
A
Wrote back I moved away
B
They called me up to say they know that I'm still here

E
So on the 5th day of the 5th month 
B
At 5 o'clock in the dawn
C#m
I rolled myself in a T-O-P 
A
And jumped out on Highway One
G#m
With a 400 engine hot as a cremation coffin
A
And a tailgate bangin' like an airplane wing
B
I was rollin' on the highway doing it my way whistling "Someday" and singing this song

(Repeat chords through end, as Serge sings "I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes...")
