Lodi
Creedence Clearwater Revival
 	G	C	G
J	ust about a year ago I s	et out on the r	oad
 	Em	C	D
Seeking my fame and 	fortune, 	looking for a pot of 	gold

I g	uess you know the t	une

Oh Lord, I'm st	uck in Lodi ag	ain

R	an out of time and m	oney
 	C	G
L	ooks like they took my fr	iends

Chorus
 	G	C	G
The m	an from the magazine s	aid I was on my w	ay
 	Em	C	D
Somewhere I lost conn	ections, r	an out of songs to pl	ay

 	C	G
L	ooks like my plans fell thr	u

Chorus

 	A	D	A
I	f I only had a dollar for 	every song I've s	ung
 	F#m	D	E
And every time I've h	ad to play, while p	eople sat there dr	unk
 	A	F#m
You kn	ow I'd catch the n	ext train
 	D	A
B	ack to where I l	ive

 	Oh Lord, I'm 	stuck in Lodi 	again...
