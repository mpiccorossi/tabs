Let me ride on the wall of death one more time

You can waste your time on the other rides

but this is the nearest to being alive

A D E A Asus4 A
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Deat h
You can go with the crazy people in the crooked house
You can fly away on the rocket or spin in the mouse
The tunnel of love might amuse you
And Noah's Ark might confuse you but
Let me take my chances on the Wall of Death
Bm F#m
On the Wall of Death
Bm F#m E
All the World is far from me
Bm F#m
On the Wall of Death
Bm F#m D E
It's the nearest to being free
Well you're going nowhere when you ride on the carousel
And maybe you're strong, but what's the good of ringing a bell
The switchback will make you crazy
Beware of the bearded lady
Oh let me take my chances on the Wall of Death
(guitar solo over bridge chords)
Repeat first verse
